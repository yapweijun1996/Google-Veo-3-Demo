# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a web-based chatbox interface that allows users to send text prompts to Google's Veo 3 AI model and generate videos based on those prompts. The application will be built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any frameworks, providing a simple and lightweight solution for video generation through AI.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to enter a text prompt in a chatbox interface, so that I can generate a video based on my description.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the application THEN the system SHALL display a chatbox interface with a text input field
2. WHEN the user types a prompt in the input field THEN the system SHALL accept text input up to a reasonable character limit
3. WHEN the user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL send the prompt to the Veo 3 API for video generation
4. WHEN the prompt is submitted THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator to show video generation is in progress

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the status of my video generation request, so that I know when my video will be ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation starts THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator with status messages
2. WHEN the system polls for operation status THEN the system SHALL update the user with current progress
3. WHEN video generation is complete THEN the system SHALL notify the user that the video is ready
4. IF video generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and download the generated video, so that I can use it for my purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation is complete THEN the system SHALL display the generated video in the interface
2. WHEN the video is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide video playback controls
3. WHEN the user wants to save the video THEN the system SHALL provide a download option
4. WHEN the user clicks download THEN the system SHALL save the video file to the user's device

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send multiple prompts in a conversation format, so that I can generate multiple videos in one session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a prompt THEN the system SHALL add the prompt to a conversation history
2. WHEN video generation completes THEN the system SHALL add the result to the conversation history
3. WHEN the user sends a new prompt THEN the system SHALL maintain the previous conversation context
4. WHEN the conversation grows long THEN the system SHALL provide scrolling to view all messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle API authentication securely, so that my API credentials are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL require Google GenAI API configuration
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication headers
3. IF API authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN handling API keys THEN the system SHALL not expose them in client-side code inappropriately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive interface, so that I can use the application on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern chatbox interface
2. WHEN viewed on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout responsively
3. WHEN interacting with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback
